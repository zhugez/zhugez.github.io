Greetings, everyone! I go by the name Zhuge and I am currently pursuing my final year of studies in Computer Science at the university. During my leisure time, I relish playing musical instruments, with a special inclination towards the piano. Additionally, I have a keen interest in reading books and sketching. My ultimate ambition is to become a red teamer.
